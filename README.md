CSC_Data_Structures_I/CSC300_HW3:
  - Create two MyLoan objects -- one for the 15 year loan, and another for the 30 year loan, in every session.
  - Print the first line of the analysis for each Loan by calling the toString() method.
  - The monthly and total payments must be obtained by calling the monthlyPayment() and totalPayment() methods respectively (and in no other way).  Those values must be printed with two decimal digits (and followed by a $).  
  - Repeat the session as long as the user wants.
  
CSC_Data_Structures_I/CSC300_HW4:
  - Write a definition of a class named Tile that represents a Scrabble tile (in "Tile.java").
  - Complete the class RandomBag by adding the following three methods:
      - public void shuffle() 
      - public E randomRemoveOne()
      - public void trimToSize()
  - Stores a collection of items in an array and, in addition to the standard methods such as add() and size(), it allows the client to pick an  item randomly (and the item is removed from the bag).
  - Application program which uses the Tile and RandomBag classes.  The program should do the following, in this order:
      - Create an RandomBag object which stores Tile objects.
      - Add the following tiles in the bag -- 'E' (value 1, add 2 of them), 'A' (value 1, add 2 of them), 'I' (value 1, add 1 of them), 'R' (value 1, add 1 of them), 'C' (value 3, add 1 of them), 'P' (value 3, add 1 of them),  'K' (value 5, add 1 of them), 'J' (value 3, add 1 of them).
      - Select 3 tiles randomly and create a String from those tiles (in the order they were selected). Then display the string AND the string's (total) value to System.out.
